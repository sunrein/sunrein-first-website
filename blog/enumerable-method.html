    <h2>Enumerable Method - Map 11/1/2015<br>
    What it does, how it works</h2>
    <p>
   When writing this blog post, I was very interested in looking at the method .map. I have seen it used a few times, but was never sure what it was doing. I don't think the fact that it's name doesn't as bluntly refer to what action it performs (like .each or .times, for instance). .map is a method that performs an action to each element in a data set, and .map! can be used destructively to permanently alter the data structure (while of course, .map, does not do this). It is the exact same method as .collect, whose name I also find confusing. Neither of them allude directly to the fact that they alter a data set. I read that .map is more commonly used, so I'll stick with that one. A helpful website I found said to think of it like you're "remapping" the data.
   </p>

   <p>
   The way it works is really simple. You take the data, decide how you want to alter it, and then use the following syntax:

 		</p>
	 <p>
 	The result of this program will return squares of all of the numbers in the array. It will do this in a new array, so .map is inherently non-destructive. Keep in mind that .map! will permanently alter those numbers to their squares in my_array.
 	</p>
 	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 	<p>
 	And that's it! .map is actually pretty simple, once you know what it does. I still find the name misleading, but I'm sure it will become intuitive with more time and practice. Good luck!

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was pretty simple. We both were on the same page for what we wanted the wireframe to look like (very simple), and from there, we divvied up the work pretty equally. I made the wireframe and showed him through screenshare, and he did the code. Because we did not make it overly complicated, we were able to figure it out in almost no time. I liked wireframing with a peer more than doing it alone because it was nice to have some feedback on what I was doing, as well as a better understanding of the task itself, and seeing what another person made of it.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I think it is good to think about the website's structure, but once I practice with HTML enough times, I will have an automatic vision of what each tag accomplishes, and then I think wireframing will be somewhat unnecessary. But for now, it is a nice tool in which to orient myself from page to screen.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We went for simplicity and usability over all else. We didn't want to complicate the site too much, so we kept it to the major main components of a header, the body of the post itself, and a footer. Therefore, all of the things we need will be accessible and versatile when we learn CSS later.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

We learned the difference in structure types, and decided that <article> is the best for the blog. This took a bit of research, but it was nice to know the difference between them. We also made use of the <nav> tag, because we thought it important to have a navigation bar at the top under the header.
