How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was pretty simple. We both were on the same page for what we wanted the wireframe to look like (very simple), and from there, we divvied up the work pretty equally. I made the wireframe and showed him through screenshare, and he did the code. Because we did not make it overly complicated, we were able to figure it out in almost no time. I liked wireframing with a peer more than doing it alone because it was nice to have some feedback on what I was doing, as well as a better understanding of the task itself, and seeing what another person made of it.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I think it is good to think about the website's structure, but once I practice with HTML enough times, I will have an automatic vision of what each tag accomplishes, and then I think wireframing will be somewhat unnecessary. But for now, it is a nice tool in which to orient myself from page to screen.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We went for simplicity and usability over all else. We didn't want to complicate the site too much, so we kept it to the major main components of a header, the body of the post itself, and a footer. Therefore, all of the things we need will be accessible and versatile when we learn CSS later.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

We learned the difference in structure types, and decided that <article> is the best for the blog. This took a bit of research, but it was nice to know the difference between them. We also made use of the <nav> tag, because we thought it important to have a navigation bar at the top under the header.
