    <h2>Building a professional website - 11/28/15<br>
    </h2>
    <p>
    I've been coding here for nine weeks now. In that time, I have built my own website and learned several different coding languages. When I started learning CSS, I didn't like it, but I've grown to find things I like about it, as well as every other language I've tried out. The trickiest thing about CSS is positioning, and the many ways that it can be achieved. However, once you know how it works, it is pretty straight forward. I've always liked to decorate and design, so the process of building a website was a fun challenge for me. At times I struggled in terms of content to put on the site, but I really liked constructing pages, thinking of code examples to include on the page, and writing these blogs.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is definitely a benefit to having a page like this. Not only do I get to hone and enhance my coding knowledge by creating examples here, but I also can demonstrate what I've learned and at what rate I've learned it all. It seems like I've absorbed a lot over these past nine weeks, and I'm excited to keep learning. I hope to continue maintaining this blog so I can continue to demonstrate and practice my skills.
