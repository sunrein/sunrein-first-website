    <h2>What is Rails? 11/21/15<br>
    A look into Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p>
   I've heard the phrase "Rails," or "Ruby on Rails," thrown around a lot. However, I wasn't entirely sure what it was, even though I've been studying programming for over a month now. I understand by its title that it somehow involves Ruby, but that was the extent of my knowledge. I decided I wanted to look more into what this phrase actually refers to, since it is something we should probably be familiar with.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Rails, exactly?</h3>
    <p>
    Ruby on Rails is a software library installed on the operating system in the form of a RubyGem. It adds functionality to the Ruby programming language, specifically when it comes to building websites and web applications. This means that Ruby can be easily integrated with databases, CSS, HTML, and other coding languages when using the Rails framework. The man who created Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson, developed Rails as a way to standardize web app development conventions, making them universal. This makes it much easier for other developers to read and modify your code, if everyone is using the same conventions. These conventions, also known as the Rails API (application programming interface), can be found online. This further proves how accessible Ruby is to coders because of its open source nature.
    </p>
    <p>
    As very well-stated on railsapps.github.io, "Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to dynamically assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database)."
    </p>
    <h3>Some benefits of using Rails</h3>
    <p>
    Because it is a standardized system, Rails isn't just a framework or a set of standardizing guidelines. Rails has a community behind it: all of the other Rails developers. This makes open source projects easier to contribute to, and is enhanced even further by the accessibility offered by git and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
    Having a web app development framework saves the developer a lot of time. They are not solely responsible for implementing all of the infrastructure themselves. Not only does this make the developer's life easier, but it will be much easier for another developer to understand later, if they both have knowledge of the framework. This relates to the communal benefits of Rails I mentioned earlier. When more people use Rails, collaboration is easier and there is a larger pool of developers all adding and enhancing the Rails framework. This speeds up development if everyone is using and understands Rails as a somewhat universal standard, at least in terms of Ruby development.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another benefit is that Rails is an opinionated language (to an extent). Although there is room for experimentation, Rails is a set of standards and conventions. This means that there is a "Rails Way" to solving problems and implementing code, which is what I mean when I say Rails is opinionated. Heinemeier Hansson has already made the choices for you as a developer when he developed Rails, and while I'm sure you can circumvent the standards he created, that is one of the main benefits to using Rails. You don't have to implement the framework yourself, which saves time not only when you're developing, but also in terms of collaboration, or even maintanence, later on.
    </p>
    <p>
    It should also be noted that Rails and Ruby were developed to be syntaxically simple and DRY. Ruby largely replaced Java and PHP, challenging languages that are often not DRY. 
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    That is my basic understanding of Rails. While not fully comprehensive, I think it is important to at least know what Rails is and the purpose of it. I'm sure that it is capable of much more, and I am not exactly sure how it is implemented, but the important takeaway here is what it is for and, generally, what it does.
    </p>
    <p>
    I've only scratched the very surface of Rails here, and having never used it before, am certainly not an expert. If you're curious for more information, use <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html"><span> this extremely informational and educational website <span></a>.
