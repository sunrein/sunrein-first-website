		<h2>hello!</h2>

		<h3>would you like to know more <span>about</span> me?</h3>
		<article>
			<h3>introduction</h3>
			<p>
			Hey there! My name is Sabrina Unrein and currently a student learning about computer code remotely. I attended the University of Colorado in Boulder and graduated in May of 2015 with a degree in English Literature and Japanese Language and Civilization. And now I'm learning how to be a software engineer.
			</p>

			<h3>background</h3>

			<p>
			I was born and raised in Centennial, Colorado. Actually, I'm a fifth generation Coloradan, and have never lived anywhere but Colorado. The longest I've been away from home is when I studied abroad in Tokyo for one month last summer, so moving to Chicago for DBC makes me a bit nervous. I recently made an attempt to climb my first 14-er (a colloquial expression for a 14,000 ft mountain), a true Colorado experience.

			I definitely was not ready to move away from home for college, so I went to CU Boulder, about 50 miles away from where I grew up. I've always had a passion for books and reading, and love writing literary essays (yes, really), so being an English major really made sense. My sophomore year, I took a Japanese class and adored it, so I quickly picked up Japanese as a second major. Being a Japanese major really opened my eyes to the world and how we perceive it. I love the Japanese language and culture and would love to go back to Japan. Being there really felt like being home.

			Considering my majors, I feel like I have an aptitude for picking up languages. While computer languages aren't quite the same thing, they are similar in principle. It is all about knowing what the parts are and how they work together syntaxically. It is very different than where I thought I would be when I graudated from college. I had previously considered becoming a professor, a translator, or teaching abroad, but none of those aspirations were accessible or realisitc for me at this point in my life. Anyway, I'm really glad to have found DBC. It has been great so far!
			</p>
			<p>
			In my free time, I love to read. I have read over 100 books so far this year, and want to read as much as possible before the year is out. When I'm not too tired, I'm much more likely to turn to a book than television. I also love video games and board games. And cats. Particularly my cat, Callie. I don't get to bring her with me to Chicago, so I'm really going to miss her. I'm also going to miss my boyfriend and family, but I take the most photos of my cat.
