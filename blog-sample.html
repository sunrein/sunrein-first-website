    <h2>CSS Positioning - 10/18/2015<br>
    The differences between static, relative, absolute, and fixed</h2>
    
    <p>
      At the beginning of Week 3, we were prompted to watch a couple videos on CSS. One was over an hour long, and was a presentation entitled "CSS Sucks," subtitled "Life is Hell." While humorous, I didn't take the title too seriously. Hyperbole, I figured, for laughs.

    </p>
    <p>
    How wrong I was.
    </p>

    <p>
    One thing I wish I knew going in to CSS was the struggles of positioning. I do not know what my peers would consider the hardest part of working with CSS, but for me, this was definitley the trickiest. Unlike HTML, there are no simple tags for positioning. Rather, we have things like margin, border, and padding, as well as another category of positioning elements: static, relative, absollute, and fixed. I used the latter the most when structuring my site, for better or for worse. I am glad that I was able to figure out what all of these terms mean and what they to help structure the webpage. Whether or not what I did follows best practices, I'm not sure. But this is how these four elements work.
  </p>

  <h3>Static</h3>
  <p>
    I think that static positioning is the easiest to understand. It does what it says; it's static. This means that it won't move about the page, even if you instruct it to using commands like top, bottom, left, or right. The other nice thing about static positioning is that it is the default status of any element. You don't have to remember to set something to static, you just need to remember to specify something else if you want the element to move.
