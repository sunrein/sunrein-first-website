What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I was much more focused on positioning than padding or borders in this exercise, so I didn't actually use those at all. These are things that I might play around with later in order to really hone the way my blog looks, but I reached the 4 hour stopping point and am happy enough with what I made.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I didn't reallly understand positioning before. While the pairing session on chrometools allowed me to play with these features, they were very new to me and I didn't retain a lot of detail in terms of what made what happen. Now I understand that static is default, relative moves relative to where it would be if it were static, and absolute is when you want to define exact perameters concerning where things should go. I'm still not exactly sure what the purpose of fixed positing is.
What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Positioning is so challenging. There isn't a simple way to center or align things, or at least it seems like there should be, but in practice, it is quite difficult. I found choosing colors, fonts, and figuring out the general layout to be the most enjoyable and easiest part. Positioning is definitely why this project took so long.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I like that you can use multiple stylesheets for one page, and that they can override each other. This makes formatting page to page much easier than it would be otherwise. I learned several new elements along the way, such as adding fonts and the aforementioned positioning. Seeing as I'm still so new to CSS, any experimenting I do with it in the future will probably be much like today: trial and error.
